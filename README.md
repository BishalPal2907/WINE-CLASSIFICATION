# WINE-CLASSIFICATION

A large number of features available in a dataset may result in overfitting of learning model .
The goal is to project a dataset(wine dataset) onto a lower dimensional space with good class separability in order to avoid overfitting and also reduce computational cost.

FOR THIS PURPOSE I HAVE USED LDA(Linear Discriminant Analysis) for dimensional reductionality and then train the model 
It is a predictive modelling and machine learning algorithm for multi-class classification
Helpful for pattern classification

SOFTWARE USED-
JUPYTER NOTEBOOK

STEPS-
1)IMPORTING DATASET 
2)SPLITTING DATASET INTO TRAINING AND TEST SET
3)PERFORMED NORMALIZATION - standard scaler library used
4)CONFUSION MATRIX USED FOR ACCURACY
5)DATA VISUALIZATION - listed colour map
